= Guide

[quote, Douglas Adams, The Restaurant at the End of the Universe]
The Guide is definitive. Reality is frequently inaccurate.

The guide is a longer walkthrough of the Sylt language. It aims to describe how
to write Sylt and in some cases why you might want to do something in a certain
way. It is mainly intended for new users of Sylt who want a guided walkthrough
of the language. For a shorter reference with less text to read and more
examples to copy, check out the link:quick-reference.html[Quick Reference].

== About the guide

The guide expects at least basic familiarity with programming. If you haven't
done any programming at all, consider something like a beginner's tutorial to
Python or Lua, other languages which Sylt takes some inspiration from.

If you haven't already, install Sylt according to
link:index.html[the instructions over at the homepage].

== Values and variables

There are 4 basic types of values which can be composed in lists, tuples, sets,
dicts and blobs. Functions, which are a kind of value, are described in *REF*.

=== Variables and constant variables

Values can be assigned to variables, which works just the way you expect it to.

Variables can optionally be declared as _constant_. Constant variables will
always point to the same value, but the value itself can still be modified (if
it is modifiable. The basic values (int, float, bool and string) and tuples
aren't modifiable while lists, sets, dicts and blobs are. This means that you
can add and remove elements from a constant list but not increment a constant
integer.

[source, sylt]
----
num := 1       // a variable declaration
PI :: 3.14     // a constant declaration
NUMBERS :: []  // a constant declaration
----

Constant variables (apart from functions) should be written in
`SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`.

The type of the variable is inferred but can be supplied or even forced; see *REF*.

== If statements and if expressions

These are your standard control flow statements.

.Regular if statements
[source, sylt]
----
if 1 == 2 do
    print' "impossible. perhaps the archives are incomplete."
end

if 12345679 * 81 == 999999999 do
    print' "math is fun!"
end
----

If expressions evaluate to different values depending on a condition.

.If expressions, as seen in e.g. Python
[source, sylt]
----
a := 5 if b == 0 else 1
----

If expressions can usually be written as a normal if statement but they might be
shorter and easier to follow. Consider the following example where we draw the
color of a player red if their team is set to 0 or blue otherwise.

.If expression example
[source, sylt]
----
color := (1.0, 0.0, 0.0) if player.team == 0 else (0.0, 0.0, 1.0)
draw_rectangle' player.position, player.size, player.rotation, color

// the same code with an if statement instead

if player.team == 0 do
    draw_rectangle' player.position, player.size, player.rotation, (1.0, 0.0, 0.0)
else do
    draw_rectangle' player.position, player.size, player.rotation, (0.0, 0.0, 1.0)
end
----

// A shortened form is available if the pass-branch is also the left hand side of
// the condition.
//
// .A motivating example for the short if-expression
// [source, sylt]
// ----
// // These two are equivalent
// a := (b + 5.) / 10. if (b + 5.) / 10. > 1. else 0.
// //   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
// a := (b + 5.) / 10. if > 1. else 0.
// //   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    ^^^^
// ----

== Operators

The basic arithmetic operators are all here. Standard mathematical evaluation
order applies.

.Arithmetic operators
[source, sylt]
----
1 + 1       // 2
2 - 2       // 0
3 * 3       // 9
-4          // -4
// integer division when dividing integers:
10 / 2      // 5
10 / 3      // 3 (note the truncation)
// float division when dividing floats
10.0 / 2.0  // 5.0 (float division)
// type error when mixing ints and floats, even for division
10 / 2.0    // type error, can't divide int and float
----

.Comparison operators
[source, sylt]
----
1 < 2        // true
2 > 1        // true
1.0 <= 1.0   // true
1.0 >= 2.0   // false
"a" == "a"   // true
"a" != "a"   // false


// assert equal. continue only if the values compare equal
[1, 2] <=> [1, 2]
----

.Parenthesis for grouping
[source, sylt]
----
(1 + 1) * 2  // 4
----

.Boolean operators
[source, sylt]
----
true or false  // true
true and true  // true
not true       // false
----

== Imports

Code can be written in multiple files, to your liking. You don't have to
consider include-ordering or dependency cycles. Write your code anywhere you
want!

In this example, the file name of each listing is written as a comment at the
top.

[source, sylt]
----
// a.sy
use b  // imports "b.sy"

start :: fn do
    print(b.HELLO)
end
----

[source, sylt]
----
// b.sy
use a  // cycles are OK

HELLO :: "hello!"
----

All varialbes declared outside of functions will be reachable. Remember that
functions are values too! Also, beware of global and mutable variables, unless
you know they're what you need. :)

Files are imported relative to the current file. With a leading "/" the path is
started from the directory containing the file being run rather than the file
the import is written in. This is useful if a file is located a few directories
down.

[source, sylt]
----
// a/b/c.sy
use d.sy   // imports "a/b/d.sy"
use /d.sy  // imports "d.sy"
----

A directory can also be used if it is supplied with a trailing "/", which will
import the file "exports.sy" in that directory. This can be used to create
modules encapuslating related code and a central "exporting-file".

[source, sylt]
----
// a.sy
use d/  // imports "d/exports.sy"
----

All imports can be aliased to other names.

[source, sylt]
----
// a.sy
use b as c   // imports "b.sy" under the namespace c
use c/ as d  // imports "c/exports.sy" under the namespace d,
             // since the namespace c is already used
----

== Loops

Apart from the simple `loop`, other kinds of loops are supplied by the
standard library as higher-order functions.

=== loop

The `loop` keyword can be used to create looping code similar to the `while`
keyword in languages like C and Python. The main difference is that the
condition may be omitted to create an infinite loop.

[source, sylt]
----
loop do
    print("y")
end

stack := [1, 2, 3]
loop len(stack) > 0 do
    print(pop(stack))
end
----

=== for_each

`for_each` applies a function on every element in a list. If the elements are
mutable (e.g. another list, see *REF*) it can be mutated.

[source, sylt]
----
l := [1, 2, 3]

l -> for_each' fn a: int do print(a) end

l -> for_each' fn a: int do
    // many statements
end
----

.Functions can be defined somewhere else.
[source, sylt]
----
Player :: blob {
    pos: (int, int)
    vel: (int, int)
}

update_player :: fn p: Player do
    p.pos += p.vel
end

// ...
players -> for_each' update_player
----

== Types and the type system

Sylt is statically typed, which means that every variable and every expression
has an assigned type. Types allow the Sylt compiler to catch common errors,
such as passing the wrong argument to a function, without ever having to run
the program.

[source, sylt]
----
greet :: fn message: str do
    print("Hello " + message + "!")
end

greet("world") // Ok
greet(1)       // Type error
----

=== Basic types

These types are the building blocks of the type system. These examples show off
what the values and variables of a given type might look like.

.Integers
[source, sylt]
----
integer: int = 1
1 + 1 <=> 2
-69
----

.Floats
[source, sylt]
----
decimal: float = 1.0
(0.1 + 0.2) / 0.3
1.  // trailing 0 optional
.5  // leading 0 optional
----

.Strings
[source, sylt]
----
string: str = "string"
print("Hello, World!")
"non empty" + "" <=> "non empty"
----

.Booleans
[source, sylt]
----
is_true: bool = true
not false <=> true
5 > 4 <=> true
----

.Void
[source, sylt]
----
nothing: void = nil
----

=== Composite types

The basic types are very useful on their own, but sometimes more advanced types
are required. The list, for example, is a composite type since it can contain
other types.

.Lists
[source, sylt]
----
numbers: [int] = [1, 2, 3]
numbers -> push' 4
print(numbers[0]) // 1
print(numbers[3]) // 4
----

.Tuples
[source, sylt]
----
position: (float, float) = (5.0, 10.0)
position + (1.0, 1.0) <=> (6.0, 11.0) // Vector addition
position * 2. <=> (10.0, 20.0) // Scaling
print(position[0]) // 5.0
position[0] = 1.0 // Error, tuples are immutable
unit: () = ()
----

.Dicts
[source, sylt]
----
dict: {str: int} = {"one": 1, "two": 2}
dict["one"] <=> 1
dict["three"] = 3
empty_dict := {:}
----

.Sets
[source, sylt]
----
set: {int} = {1, 1, 2, 2}
set <=> {1, 2}
----

.Functions
[source, sylt]
----
square: fn int -> int : fn x: int -> int do
    //  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ This is the type.
    x * x
end
// Usually the function type is omitted.
square :: fn x: int -> int do
    x * x
end
----

=== Type manipulation

There are even more things that can be done with types. For instance it is
possible to completely ignore the type system.

.Forcing types
[source, sylt]
----
definitely_a_number: !int = "oh no"
1 + definitely_a_number // Ok(?)
----

The above example will compile and run. It might run perfectly, crash or do a
backflip. Because the errors are not caught by the typesystem, forced types
should be used sparingly. Only use them when you are 100% sure the program is
correct and you have exhausted your other options.

Sometimes a single variable may have values of different types. Such variables
may be represented as union-types.

.Type unions
[source, sylt]
----
number: int | float = 1
number = 1.0 // Ok, number may be a float

maybe_string: str? = nil // Shorthand for str | void
maybe_string = "string"
----

=== Blobs

Blobs are a way of creating user-defined types similar to structs in C and
objects in JavaScript.

.Blob creation and field access
[source, sylt]
----
Creature :: blob {
    hp: int,
    position: (float, float),
}

spider := Creature { hp: 5, position: (0.0, 0.0) }
spider.hp <=> 5
spider.position <=> (0.0, 0.0)
----

It is often desirable to have a function that can create blobs of a specific
type. Such a function, usually called a _constructor_, can be implemented as
follows.

.A blob constructor
[source, sylt]
----
Spider :: blob {
    hp: int,
    position: (float, float),
    eat_bug: fn -> void,
}

new_spider :: fn x: float, y: float -> Spider do
    self: !Spider = nil // Set up the variable
    self = Spider {
        hp: 5,
        position: position,
        eat_bug: fn do
            self.hp += 1
        end,
    }
    ret self
end

spider := new_spider(0.0, 0.0)
----

Notice that the `Spider` blob has many fields in common with the `Creature`
blob from before. This fact can be used to do something called
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing[duck typing], which effectively
allows us to assign `Spider` blobs to `Creature` variables.

.Duck typing
[source, sylt]
----
creatures: [Creature] = []
creatures -> push' new_spider' 0.0, 0.0
creatures[0].hp -= 1   // Ok
creatures[0].eat_bug() // Type error
----

This type error may seem counter-intuitive. We know that `creatures[0]` is a
`Spider` which has the `eat_bug` function, yet we are not allowed to call it.
What is really going on here? Once the `Spider` blob is put into the list
of type `[Creature]` some type information is lost, meaning, there is no
reliable way of knowing the true type of something in the list. `creatures` is
a list of `Creature`s and other blobs containing the same fields as `Creature`,
though every element is treated as if being of type `Creature`.

To call the `eat_bug` function anyway, forced types may be used.

.Force general blob into specific blob
[source, sylt]
----
spider: !Spider = creatures[0]
spider.eat_bug() // Ok, as long as creatures[0] is a Spider
----

== Standard library
